# Conference
<p>Bad code first ASP.NET project and first TypeScript React project</p>
<p>Oriented on fast development</p>
<p>Testing the performance of sometimes the craziest patterns, work aimed at pumping skills to adapt to new technologies, which almost always do not correspond to my vision of clean code</p>
<p>Lots of repetitive code, refactoring planned</p>
