# Conference
<p>Bad code project</p> 


https://github.com/artcoed/conference/assets/90335472/446f1863-c032-4ddb-8dde-c791c7b45da8

<p>First ASP.NET project and first TypeScript React project</p>
<p>Oriented on fast development</p>
<p>Testing the performance of sometimes the craziest patterns, work aimed at pumping skills to adapt to new technologies, which almost always do not correspond to my vision of clean code</p>
<p>Lots of repetitive code, refactoring planned</p>
